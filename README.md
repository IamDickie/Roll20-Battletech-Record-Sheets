# Roll20-Battletech-Record-Sheets

This is the start of putting together record sheets (RS) from the *Total Warfare* scale of Battletech for use on Roll20. The "Battletech-Total Warfare Record Sheets.html" file is planned to be a "master" sheet to allow combined arms engagements, and possibly even an *A Time of War* character sheet tab(s).

Need to do:
- fully clean and document attributes in mech sheet file
- Ammo section still missing
- Heat scale/tracking
- Other bits of basic information such as tech base, heat sink types, possibly a faction/unit designation space
- Testing
- Once these initial tasks are done, post on Roll20 for other BT players to try, test, help with CSS and other coding
