# Roll20-Battletech-Record-Sheets

This is the start of putting together record sheets (RS) from the *Total Warfare* scale of Battletech for use on Roll20. The "Battletech-Total Warfare Record Sheets.html" file is planned to be a "master" sheet to allow combined arms engagements, and possibly even an *A Time of War* character sheet tab(s).

Need to do:
- Should a faction/unit designation space (mech sheet) be added?
- Testing (mech sheet)

Recent Updates:
- Began custom Solaris VII League sheet (HTML and CSS)
- Added "Design Quirks" section (mech sheet)
- Mostly cosmetic changes to armor/crit table for mech sheet (mech sheet)
- Created .css file for mech sheet (mech sheet)
